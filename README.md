# JSCalculator
Basic Calculator built using HTML and CSS frontend and Javascript for backend logic.

Yes there is a very simple way to build a JS Calc eg using just the eval() function, but here we are trying to build a more dynamic calculator.

For example, the display is not just a mere input html tag but a div, therefore you cant just type anything into the display, and you can only use the 
calc. keys.

Also manage user errors such as if someone tries to add more than one decimal point to the displayed Number.

I also try and use some of the more interesting html5 features such as Event Delegation. Making use of the HTMLElement.dataset attribute to store values.
